# NYC-Airbnb
This is a project for my Data Wrangling class about NYC airbnb listings and how things like price and availability relate to each borough.  
When we started this project we found a very polished data-set about Airbnb data and thought we could find some insight using it. At first, we thought we could compare the data to some vrbo data. We werent able to work with this idea, so we decided to look at location affects these properties.
In order to compare the airbnb data to a city, we had to choose a city with substantial properties so we scraped a website giving us data of New York City that we can relate.
The data we got from the web-scraping include information about regarding income levels and household numbers for each borough.
After gathering all our data we then coded R-scripts to find some insight. We looked at a lot of different correlations between data like available listings and total households.
Lastly, we made visuals to add to our explaination of our insights and drated our report will all our final findings.
